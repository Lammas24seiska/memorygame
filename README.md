# Memory Game
A simple browser game where the goal is to remember a pattern an repeat it.

## Overview
This is a simple vanilla Javascript game where the goal is to remember an ever increasing sequence of patterns which are represented by monsters that make a sound and an animation. The game features three difficulyt levels (amount of monsters) and multiple languages (English and Finnish by default)

The goal of this project was to bring back the memory on how simple JavaScript is programmed with the aim to be able to more easily move to more advanced topics and libraries in the future.
